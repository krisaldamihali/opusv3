                            in Java typically run faster than

                            Machine Learning is the field of study 
                            that gives computers the capability to 
                            learn without being explicitly 
                            programmed. ML is one of the most exciting
                            technologies that one would have ever 
                            come across. As it is evident from the 
                            name, it gives the computer that makes 
                            it more similar to humans: The ability 
                            to learn. Machine learning is actively 
                            being used today, perhaps in many more 
                            places than one would expect.
